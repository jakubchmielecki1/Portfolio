              <h1>üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Project</h1>
              As part of my engineering thesis, I developed a dedicated CMS for
              managing hearing prosthetics clinics. The system was built in
              collaboration with a practicing clinic to meet real-world needs ‚Äî
              from patient intake to hearing aid fitting and final sale. It
              includes modules for client management, inventory, medical
              partners, discounts, and scheduling. The app was built with
              Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It‚Äôs available at
              sluchapp.com ‚Äî public users can view the landing page, while full
              access is reserved for verified clinic staff approved by
              administrators.
