              In my free time, I dedicate myself to my passion â€” Front-end
              Development. Choosing this field of study was a deliberate step
              toward becoming a skilled Front-end Developer and deepening my
              knowledge in web technologies. During the summer break between

              allowed me to further develop my skills and focus on
              self-improvement by doing what I truly enjoy. You can find
